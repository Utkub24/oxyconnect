# Oxyconnect

## What is this project?
I'm not really sure, to be honest. Something to do with data transfer over the network.

## How to?
Do a `cargo run` and I'm sure the awesome CLI generated by [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) will guide you.

## Future plans
- Move to a more robust I/O library like mio, or tokio if needed.
- Write a custom protocol for the fun of it.
- GUI? [Maybe.](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri)
- Cross platform? Possibly.
- Mobile support? Ask again a few years later.
